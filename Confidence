Hi Folks,

Today, I got little tired, it's friday.
So, I was watching movies, YouTube.

But I had some doubts on Table in HTML. So, I searhced a random table image on Google and started coding on it. First time it was almost there
around 70%. After playing with my code, I got the expected output. 

I am very happy today. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

It feels great and completed the basics in HTML and let's see the CSS tomorrow or Monday. Since it's a weekend. I am constantly studying. 
So, I need a pause button.

You can check the table here: https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/table.png
And the code here:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table border="black">
        <caption>Homework</caption>
        <tr>
            <td>quick</td>
            <td colspan="2">brownfox</td>
            <td>jumps</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="3">over the</td>
            <td>lazy</td>
            <td>dog</td>
            <td>and</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>then</td>
            <td>it</td>
            <td>fall</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="3">it is fine</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
